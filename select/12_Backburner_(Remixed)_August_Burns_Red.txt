Convictions to the back burner
Convictions to the back burner
Remembering what's really important isn't so important after all
Gather all your possessions, and smile because you've got it all
Gather all your possessions, and smile because you've got it all
Smile because you've got it all
Smile because you've got it all
Still that empty feeling won't go away (Go away)
Still that empty feeling won't go away (Go away)
Your puzzle's missing one very essential piece
And I know you'll keep looking in all the wrong places until it's too late
Too late
Slip on the ice again
When did you become so cold?
Living for the here and now never made so much sense
Slip on the ice again
When did you become so cold?
You think you've got all the time in the world, but this could all be ending now
How far down will you go before it's too late?
Slipping on the ice again, you've become so cold
Lucky for you rock bottom is in sight
Lucky for you rock bottom is in sight
Your wake up call is set for now
And the trail you have followed has come all the way to the end
I hope you survive, survive the crash
