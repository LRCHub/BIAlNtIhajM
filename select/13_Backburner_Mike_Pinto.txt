Oh, is it true? Is it true?
Or have I been mistaken?
Oh, is it you? Is it you who started this trouble makin'?
Sure, I'm a fool, I'm a fool for puttin' my heart in such a situation
I tried to keep my cool, keepa my cool
Baby, I've grown impatient
Well you've got my attention
Now was that your intention?
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Well, when I start thinking 'bout you and me
Gets my pulse racin' (racin', racin')
You don't seem to care much about me
When I'm looking in your direction (in your direction)
Oh, Girl you can take it or leave it
Baby, are you too blind to see that you're leaving me high 'n' dry? (high 'n' dry)
And when you're takin' my love girl, while you wait for another
You've gone and crossed the line (crossed the line, crossed the line)
Well, you've got my attention
Now was that your intention?
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
I've been waitin' a long, long time for a girl like you
But I ain't wasting any one of my days
'Cause I got better things to do
You're givin' me grief, but I ain't no thief
You seem to be the one who misunderstood
'Cause you keep turning your back
Turning your back, when things were just gettin' good
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
Baby don't put me on your backburner
