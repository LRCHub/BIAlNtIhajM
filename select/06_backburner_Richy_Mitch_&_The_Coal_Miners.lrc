[00:37.35] Time is on your side
[00:44.55] Time is on your side
[00:54.55] 
[00:51.59] So waiting and waiting
[00:54.45] For the time to arrive
[00:58.62] And the parts of me not waiting
[01:01.98] Were just waiting to die
[01:13.98] 
[01:36.42] Time is on your side
[01:43.93] Time is on your side
[01:53.93] 
[01:50.34] So I'll go through my days
[01:53.26] And hang on through the ride
[01:57.77] And I'll wait and I'll wait
[02:00.59] Until the timing is right
